js is synchronous single threaded lang
hoisting assign a space to variable
lexial connection with parents variable
closure a function reference to its lexial env is closure

var is function scope
let and const are block scope

let a =10
var b = 10
const c =10
{
let a =20
}



script 
 a=10
 c=10

block
 a=20

global
 b=10





callstack
event loop
call back queue
micro task queue


higher order function map filter reduce

polyfill means proto type similar to Array.prototype or array._proto_._proto_

call apply bind

curry by using bind or closures

bubbling(hitting six) and capture 

event delegation(reducing click events using bubblinga and capture)
Benefits of event delegation:
1) improves memory space
2) mitigates risk of performance bottle neck
3) Dom manipulation
4) when elements get added dynamically, the process of adding events is slow
Limitations:
1) All the events are not bubbled up, some events like blur, focus are not bubbled up
2) if e.stopPropogation is used in child, then events are not bubbled up



debouncing(search engine reducing api calls in network)
